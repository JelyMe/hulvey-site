            Hulvey, a twenty-three year old Brunswick, GA native, went from dropping out of college, scrubbing toilets at Publix, to becoming Reach Records latest breakout hip hop artist. His label debut EP, BRKNHRT dropped in 2020 and immediately garnered him national praise.  Pandora named him “Christian Artist to Watch in 2020”, his tracks ‘Higher’ and ‘Real Love’ from Hulvey Vol. 1 and Hulvey Vol. 2 were featured on VH1’s Love and Hip Hop Atlanta in 2020 and ‘Cold Blooded’ was featured on ABC’s hit show ‘The Rookie’. Shortly after BRKNHRT released, the world shut down, entering into a global pandemic.  Having to put the hopes of touring and performing on hold, Hulvey, like the rest of the world, found himself in his bedroom, secluded from his friends and family, where he was forced to face his insecurities and fears and surrender them to God. It was then, his forthcoming debut album, set to release in 2021, was born.
